# Frontend Mentor - Blogr landing page

![Design preview for the Blogr landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This website is build with HTML, SCSS and bootstrap for responsive navbar .
The biggest challenge for me to build a navbar with both dropdown and collapse but this is where bootstrap comes in handy.
Although the navbar is not fully customizable, I can build a really complicated navbar without having some much trouble.
